# TwitterDMTools
TwitterDMTools is a suite of functions that are used to collect, analyse, and visualise live tweets. The package aims to streamline the process of gathering tweet data and extracting relevant information from it. Visuals include simple statistical plots but also abstract word clouds and topic models. 

For a detailed description of the package, how to use it, and some examples of what it can do, please view the "TDMT Vignette.pdf" above.
